    "Using the RTS Flight data from 2005 to 2008, I created a data story to help narrow down a location, start airport, airline, and travel month for a short weekend vacation from my home in the Bay Area. Data was prefiltered in python (with `Download_and_filtering.ipynb`) to narrow the dataset down to three local airports (San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose), six potential vacation airports (Los Angeles (LAX), Las Vegas, San Diego, Portland, Seattle and Denver), and for flights that leave the Bay Area on a Friday and return on a Monday. My story walks through a process in which I further narrow my choices for vacation parameters by selecting for reduced arrival delay times and mitigating cancellation risk. \n"
